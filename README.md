# Build a Basic CNN using Keras

This is a beginner's guide to developing a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using the Keras library in Python. The CNN will be used to perform a basic image classifcation task on the MNIST dataset.

## Environment setup

You will require the following software to perform this task:

- *Python 2.7* (or above)
- *pip* (a python package installer)
- *Keras* (a python library for working with neural nets)
- *NumPy* (a python library to help manage large arrays of data)
- *Matplotlib* (a python library for plotting visualisations)

Follow the installation guides below depending on your OS.
