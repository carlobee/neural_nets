This is a beginner's guide to developing a simple artificial neural network (ANN) using the Keras library in Python. The net will be used to perform a basic image classifcation task on the MNIST dataset.

## Environment setup

You will require the following software to perform this task:

- *Python 2.7* (or above)
- *pip* (a python package installer)
- *Keras* (a python library for working with neural nets)
- *NumPy* (a python library to help manage large arrays of data)
- *Matplotlib* (a python library for plotting visualisations)

There is no need to download the image dataset for this particular task as this is contained within the Keras library.

Given that python and pip have been installed on your machine, use the following terminal commands to install the required libraries:

```
pip install keras
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install numpy
```


## Implementation

### Library imports

We must firstly import the libraries we earlier installed:

```
# import libraries
from keras.datasets import mnist
from matplotlib import pyplot
```
---

### Data preperation



```
# import libraries
from keras.datasets import mnist
from matplotlib import pyplot
```
